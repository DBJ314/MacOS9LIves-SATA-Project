# MacOS9Lives SATA project
This code is part of a project to make previously unsupported SATA cards usable by Mac OS 9.

The project was started by [MacOS9Lives Forum](http://macos9lives.com/smforum/index.php) user macStuff in [this thread](http://macos9lives.com/smforum/index.php/topic,4967.0.html).

The code was written on a Mac OS 9.2.2 machine. It was made GitHub-friendly using [machfs](https://pypi.org/project/machfs/).
### Current Repository Contents
* A flash rom reader and writer (only supports the sil3124 chipset at the moment)
* A barely started driver for the sil3124 chipset
